        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated and mission-driven professional with 10 years of Army service, where I specialized in secure communications and tactical network operations. 
            As a Satellite Transportable Terminal Operator, I provided secure voice, video, and data communications through both commercial and military satellite systems. 
            Additionally, as a Command Post Node Team Leader, I successfully led multiple missions, ensuring seamless access to the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN).
            Having transitioned out of the military to support my family, I am now focused on building a career in the cybersecurity sector. 
            I am committed to furthering my education in information security and gaining the necessary experience to advance into a leadership role as a Cybersecurity Manager in the future.
